# minishell_42

## What we learned from this project: âœ…
- The ins and outs of Bash
- How to manage complex group projects
- How to parse complex strings
- How to debug a large codebase
- How to use pipes and signals

## Project Goals: ðŸŽ¯
- Recreate bash
- Store variables in an environment (env)
- Handle the following signals: `ctrl-C`, `ctrl-D` & `ctrl-\`
- Recreate bash builtins such as: `echo`, `cd`, `pwd`, `export`, `unset`, `env` & `exit`

### A basic use case of minishell, where you can use `< test.txt grep ":D" | wc -l` to find the amount of lines with a `:D` in a file

### Some basic error handeling. After running the incorrect command, it's return value is retrieved using `$?`

### Manually inserting text using heredoc (using `<<`). The string after the `<<` is the delimiter, stopping the process
